## 🎯 Aim  
To perform the exploration of prompting techniques for **AI-based video generation**, understanding how descriptive text inputs influence visual and motion outcomes.  

---

## ⚙️ Algorithm  
Explore how various prompting techniques can be used to **generate and manipulate video content** — including animations, visual effects, transitions, and summaries — using different **AI video generation models**.

---

## 🧠 Step 1: Familiarize Yourself with Video Generation Models  

Begin by exploring **free or trial-based AI video generation tools**. Each has unique capabilities and creative potential.  

| Tool | Description | Free Access |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| 🧩 **Runway Gen-2** | High-quality text-to-video and image-to-video generation with cinematic realism. | Limited free credits |
| 🧑‍💻 **Synthesia** | Avatar-based videos for tutorials, explainers, or presenters. | Free demo |
| 🎥 **Pictory** | Turns written scripts or articles into narrated videos. | Free trial |
| 🧠 **DeepBrain AI** | Realistic digital humans and AI presenters with speech. | Limited free version |
 

---

## ✍️ Step 2: Start with Simple Prompts  

Start with small, general prompts to understand baseline behavior.  

**Example Prompt:**  
> “A seed sprouting into a small plant.”   

---

## 🎨 Step 3: Add Creative Details  

Enhance realism by adding environmental and emotional details.  

**Example Prompt:**  
> “A baby tree growing beside a riverbank at sunrise, water reflecting orange light, and birds flying overhead.”  

---

## ⏳ Step 4: Incorporate Time and Motion  

Add movement, transitions, or evolution of time to make the video dynamic.  

**Example Prompt:**  
> “A human evolving from a newborn to a teenager, adult, and elderly, with seasons changing from spring to winter in the background.”  

---

## 🎬 Step 5: Experiment with Video Styles  

Try generating videos in multiple styles to observe visual diversity.  

| Style | Example Prompt | Possible Output |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| 🎨 **Animation** | “A timeline of human civilization evolving from caves to skyscrapers.” | Stylized animated progression |
| 🎞️ **Cinematic** | “A drone view of a futuristic city growing from dawn to night, with glowing skyscrapers.” | Realistic cinematic tone |
| 🧚 **Artistic** | “A watercolor-style video showing the journey of a butterfly from cocoon to a flower garden.” | Hand-painted motion |
| 🌍 **Documentary** | “A glacier melting and turning into a river over years.” | Time-lapse environmental realism |

---

## 🔁 Step 6: Iterate and Refine  

Fine-tune prompts to enhance details like lighting, pacing, or camera movement.  

**Before:**  
> “A city street during rain.”  

**After Refinement:**  
> “A cinematic slow-motion view of a busy city street at night, raindrops reflecting colorful neon lights.”  

---

## 🧪 Step 7: Generate Multiple Versions  

Create slight variations in your prompt to test how wording affects output.  

**Example Variations:**  
1. “A desert turning into a green forest after rainfall.”  
2. “A barren land transforming into lush greenery with clouds forming.”  
3. “A time-lapse of Earth healing — dry land becoming fertile after monsoon.”
